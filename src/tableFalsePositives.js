Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues with aging and at sites of pathogenesis in many chronic diseases and conditions. The SASP can contribute to senescence-related inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, stem cell dysfunction, aging phenotypes, chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes, and loss of resilience. Delaying senescent cell accumulation or reducing senescent cell burden is associated with delay, prevention, or alleviation of multiple senescence-associated conditions. We used a hypothesis-driven approach to discover pro-survival Senescent Cell Anti-apoptotic Pathways (SCAPs) and, based on these SCAPs, the first senolytic agents, drugs that cause senescent cells to become susceptible to their own pro-apoptotic microenvironment. Several senolytic agents, which appear to alleviate multiple senescence-related phenotypes in pre-clinical models, are beginning the process of being translated into clinical interventions that could be transformative.", relevance: "0.97" },

Recent data show the involvement of senescent cells in tissue ageing and some age-related diseases. Skin represents an ideal model for the study of ageing. Indeed, skin ageing varies between individuals depending on their chronological age but also on their exposure to various exogenous factors (mainly ultraviolet rays). If senescence traits can be detected with ageing in the skin, the senescent phenotype varies among the various skin cell types. Moreover, the origin of cellular senescence in the skin is still unknown, and multiple origins are possible. This reflects the mosaic of skin ageing. Senescent cells can interfere with their microenvironment, either via the direct secretion of factors (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype) or via other methods of communication, such as extracellular vesicles. Knowledge regarding the impact of cellular senescence on skin ageing could be integrated into dermatology research, especially to limit the appearance of senescent cells after photo(chemo)therapy or in age-related skin diseases.

Genetic evidence has demonstrated that clearance of SCs can delay aging and extend healthspan. Senolytics, small molecules that can selectively kill SCs, have been developed to treat various age-related diseases.

On a cellular level, aging results in an increase in cells that are in a permanent cell cycle arrest, termed senescence, which secrete a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Consequently, these senescent cells negatively influence the local milieu by causing inflammaging, and by reducing the regenerative capacity of the kidney. Moreover, the oxidative damage that is inflicted by ischemia-reperfusion injury during transplantation can induce senescence and accelerate aging. In this review, we describe recent developments in the understanding of the biology of aging that have led to the development of a new class of therapeutic agents aimed at eliminating senescent cells. These compounds have already shown to be able to restore tissue homeostasis in old mice, improve kidney function and general health- and lifespan. Use of these anti-senescence compounds holds great promise to improve the quality of marginal donor kidneys as well as to remove senescent cells induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Senescent cells have been demonstrated to play a causal role in driving aging and age-related diseases using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We previously demonstrated that the combination of dasatinib and the flavonoid quercetin is a potent senolytic improving numerous age-related conditions including frailty, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to identify flavonoids with more potent senolytic activity.A panel of flavonoid polyphenols was screened for senolytic activity using senescent murine and human fibroblasts, driven by oxidative and genotoxic stress, respectively. The top senotherapeutic flavonoid was tested in mice modeling a progeroid syndrome carrying a p16Of the 10 flavonoids tested, fisetin was the most potent senolytic. Acute or intermittent treatment of progeroid and old mice with fisetin reduced senescence markers in multiple tissues, consistent with a hit-and-run senolytic mechanism. Fisetin reduced senescence in a subset of cells in murine and human adipose tissue, demonstrating cell-type specificity. Administration of fisetin to wild-type mice late in life restored tissue homeostasis, reduced age-related pathology, and extended median and maximum lifespan.The natural product fisetin has senotherapeutic activity in mice and in human tissues. Late life intervention was sufficient to yield a potent health benefit. These characteristics suggest the feasibility to translation to human clinical studies.

Radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy yielded an obstruction at the end segment of the thoracic duct, but no leakage points were found. After excluding common causes, drug-induced chylothorax was presumed. Then, dasatinib was withdrawn, and 1week later, chylothorax resolved. To further elucidate the relationship between the medication and chylothorax, dasatinib was resumed tentatively for 2days. As expected, pleural effusion recurred soon. Based on these clinical manifestations, the diagnosis of dasatinib-induced chylothorax was identified. The patient was suggested to stop dasatinib and use an alternative drug as recommended by the haematologist. Pleural effusion is the common adverse reaction of dasatinib, but chylothorax is rare. Only six cases of dasatinib-induced chylothorax have been reported, and our patient is the seventh case. Once a patient with dasatinib treatment develops chylothorax, dasatinib should be considered one of the possible causes. If no other definitive aetiological factor is identified, dasatinib discontinuation might be the optimum scheme.", relevance: "0.86" },

Engaging senescence response is suggested as a key component for therapeutic intervention in the eradication of cancer. At the same time, delaying senescence or even promote death of accumulating apoptosis-resistant senescent cells is proposed as a strategy to prevent age related diseases. Although these two desired outcome present an intrinsic dichotomy, there are examples of promising natural compounds that appear to satisfy all the requirements to develop senescence- targeted health promoting nutraceuticals. Tocotrienols (T3s) and quercetin (QUE), albeit belonging to different phytochemical classes, display similar and promising effects in vitro when tested in normal and cancer cells. Both compounds have been shown to induce senescence and promote apoptosis in a multitude of cancer lines. Conversely, they display senescence delaying activity in primary cells and rejuvenating effects in senescent cells. More recently, QUE has been shown to display senolytic effects in some primary senescent cells, likely as a consequence of its inhibitory effects on specific anti-apoptotic genes (i.e. PI3K and other kinases). Senolytic activity has not been tested for T3s but part of metabolic and apoptotic pathways affected by these compounds in cancer cells overlap with those of QUE. This suggests that the rejuvenating effects of T3s and QUE on pre-senescent and senescent primary cells might be the net results of a senolytic activity on senescent cells and a selective survival of a sub-population of non-senescent cells in the culture. The meaning of this hypothesis in the context of adjuvant therapy of cancer and preventive anti-aging strategies with QUE or T3s is discussed.", relevance: "0.85" },

Among 52patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, 17 (33%) developed PE within 18months after initial dasatinib administration, but all cases were moderate (Grade 1, 10 patients; Grade 2, 7 patients). CD56+ lymphocyte counts at 1month correlated significantly with the incidence of PE, whereas lymphocytosis did not.

Deep molecular response rates did not differ significantly between the PE groups at any time point during the observation period.

Conversely, the number of megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow of dasatinib-treated mice was increased and the ploidy of MKs derived from bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro was elevated in the presence of dasatinib. Furthermore, a significant delay in platelet recovery after immune-induced thrombocytopenia was observed in dasatinib-treated mice even though the number of MKs in the bone marrow was increased relative to controls at all time points. Interestingly, the migration of MKs toward a gradient of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and the formation of proplatelets in vitro were abolished by dasatinib.

Dasatinib treatment mediated endothelial cell dysfunction via increased production of ROS that was independent of Src family kinases. Consistent with these findings, we observed elevations in markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage in the serum of CML patients who were treated with dasatinib, compared with CML patients treated with imatinib. Taken together, our findings indicate that dasatinib causes pulmonary vascular damage, induction of ER stress, and mitochondrial ROS production, which leads to increased susceptibility to PH development.", relevance: "0.81" },

Fifty-two patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were enrolled in this study and received 100 mg dasatinib once daily. A deep molecular response (DMR) was defined as <50 copies/g RNA of BCR-ABL1 transcript value corrected by GAPDH, which ensures <0.01% of BCR-ABL1 transcript value according to International Scale (BCR-ABL1(IS)). The halving time for BCR-ABL1 transcripts was calculated using transcript levels before dasatinib treatment, transcript levels after 3 months of treatment, and the treatment time between these two points. In terms of molecular response, 38 of 51 (75%) patients reached major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months, and the rate of DMR by 18 months was 59% (30/51). While both BCR-ABL1 transcript levels before treatment and a shorter halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (14 days) were significant factors affecting achievement of MMR by 12 months, the Sokal score at diagnosis was not associated with MMR. Importantly, the halving time was the only factor that predicted achievement of DMR by 18 months. We showed that patients with CML-CP treated with dasatinib can be stratified according to the early treatment response as determined by the halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcripts.

Two years later, urine protein levels (6.19 g/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (ESR=90 mm/3.6 ks). The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. With dasatinib dose reduction, urine protein level returned to the reference range. In order to determine the best genotype-guided therapy, the patient underwent pharmacogenomic testing, showing a homozygous CYP3A4 genotype *1/*1, associated with extensive metabolizer (EM) enzyme phenotype, typical for normal rates of drug metabolism for TKIs.

The newer and more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib were first indicated for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/-intolerant patients, for whom these agents are both safe and efficacious. More recent clinical studies have examined nilotinib and dasatinib in the frontline setting in newly diagnosed patients. Data reported from the phase III ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients) study and the DASISION (Dasatinib versus Imatinib in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Chronic-phase CML) trial support the use of nilotinib and dasatinib as potential new standards for frontline care of newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase.

The effect of gastric pH modifiers on dasatinib pharmacokinetics is evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment crossover study. Twenty-four healthy subjects receive treatment A (2 doses of dasatinib 50 mg separated by 12 hours), treatment B (famotidine 40 mg given 2 hours after dasatinib 50 mg and 10 hours before another dose of dasatinib 50 mg), and treatment C (30 mL of an antacid containing aluminum/magnesium hydroxides given 2 hours before dasatinib 50 mg and concomitantly with dasatinib 50 mg 12 hours after the previous dasatinib dose); a 7-day washout separates each treatment period. When famotidine is administered 2 hours after dasatinib, dasatinib exposure is similar to dasatinib administered alone. However, dasatinib exposure is reduced by approximately 60% when famotidine is administered 10 hours before dasatinib dosing. In contrast, dasatinib exposure is unchanged when antacid (Maalox) is administered 2 hours before dasatinib; but when the antacid is coadministered with dasatinib, dasatinib exposure is reduced by approximately 55% to 58%. This indicates that H(2)-receptor antagonists should not be coadministered with dasatinib.

Dasatinib is approved for treatment of adults and children with CML-CP. A phase I study determined suitable dosing for children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. Methods CA180-226/NCT00777036 is a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized prospective trial of patients < 18 years of age receiving dasatinib. There are three cohorts: (1) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP, (2) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML in accelerated/blast phase or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 17), and (3) newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with tablets or powder for oral suspension. Major cytogenetic response > 30% for imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) > 55% for newly diagnosed patients were of clinical interest. Results Of 113 patients with CML-CP, 14 (48%) who were imatinib-resistant/intolerant and 61 (73%) who were newly diagnosed remained on treatment at time of analysis. Major cytogenetic response > 30% was reached by 3 months in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and CCyR > 55% was reached by 6 months in the newly diagnosed CML-CP group. CCyR and major molecular response by 12 months, respectively, were 76% and 41% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and 92% and 52% in newly diagnosed CML-CP group.

We explored whether nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NTKs) play a key role in fibrosis by activating cardiac fibroblasts (CFb), and could potentially serve as a target to reduce PO-induced cardiac fibrosis. Our studies were carried out in PO mouse myocardium induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Administration of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, via an intraperitoneally implanted mini-osmotic pump at 0.44 mg/kg/day reduced PO-induced accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and improved left ventricular geometry and function. Furthermore, dasatinib treatment inhibited NTK activation (primarily Pyk2 and Fak) and reduced the level of FSP1 positive cells in the PO myocardium. In vitro studies using cultured mouse CFb showed that dasatinib treatment at 50 nM reduced: (i) extracellular accumulation of both collagen and fibronectin, (ii) both basal and PDGF-stimulated activation of Pyk2, (iii) nuclear accumulation of Ki67, SKP2 and histone-H2B and (iv) PDGF-stimulated CFb proliferation and migration. However, dasatinib did not affect cardiomyocyte morphologies in either the ventricular tissue after in vivo administration or in isolated cells after in vitro treatment. Mass spectrometric quantification of dasatinib in cultured cells indicated that the uptake of dasatinib by CFb was greater that that taken up by cardiomyocytes. Dasatinib treatment primarily suppressed PDGF but not insulin-stimulated signaling (Erk versus Akt activation) in both CFb and cardiomyocytes.

First-line dasatinib is predicted to provide very poor value for money compared with first-line imatinib, with deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of between 256,000 and 450,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Using a collection of 55 leukemia patients treated with TKI therapy (chronic myeloid leukemia, n=47; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n=8), we found that dasatinib, a second-generation broad-spectrum TKI, induced a rapid, dose-dependent and substantial mobilization of non-leukemic lymphocytes and monocytes in blood peaking 1-2 h after an oral intake and the blood counts closely mirrored drug plasma concentration. A preferential mobilization was observed for natural killer (NK), NK T, B and + T cells. Mobilization was coupled with a more effective transmigration of leukocytes through an endothelial cell layer and improved cytotoxicity of NK cells. Platelet numbers decreased markedly after the drug intake in a proportion of patients. Similar effects on blood cell dynamics and function were not observed with any other TKI (imatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib). Thus, dasatinib induces a unique, rapid mobilization and activation of cytotoxic, extravasation-competent lymphocytes, which may not only enhance antileukemia immune responses but can also be causally related to the side-effect profile of the drug (pleural effusions, thrombocytopenia).", relevance: "0.79" },

The concentration ranges tested for each drug were selected to encompass the clinical Cmax concentrations. The combination regimens were found to be additive to subadditive by both methods of data analysis, but synergy was not detected. The non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were the most responsive among the tumor lines tested and the renal cell carcinoma lines were the least responsive. The bone marrows CFU-GM were more sensitive to the combination regimens than were the tumor cell lines. Based upon these data, it appears that the possibility of enhanced efficacy from combining 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and dasatinib would be associated with increased risk of severe bone marrow toxicity, so the combination is unlikely to provide a therapeutic advantage for treating solid tumor patients where adequate bone marrow function must be preserved.", relevance: "0.79" },

Imatinib mesylate, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (TKIs) is the most prominent example of this new era and has opened the way to the development of several additional TKIs, including sunitinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, sorafenib and lapatinib, in the treatment of various hematological malignancies and solid tumors. All these agents are characterized by an important inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability, are at risk for drug interactions, and are not devoid of toxicity. Additionally, they are administered for prolonged periods, anticipating the careful monitoring of their plasma exposure via Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) to be an important component of patients follow-up. We have developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) requiring 100 microL of plasma for the simultaneous determination of the six major TKIs currently in use. Plasma is purified by protein precipitation and the supernatant is diluted in ammonium formate 20 mM (pH 4.0) 1:2. Reverse-phase chromatographic separation of TKIs is obtained using a gradient elution of 20 mM ammonium formate pH 2.2 and acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid, followed by rinsing and re-equilibration to the initial solvent composition up to 20 min. Analyte quantification, using matrix-matched calibration samples, is performed by electro-spray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring detection using the positive mode. The method was validated according to FDA recommendations, including assessment of extraction yield, matrix effects variability (<9.6%), overall process efficiency (87.1-104.2%), as well as TKIs short- and long-term stability in plasma.

This is the first broad-range LC-MS/MS assay covering the major currently in-use TKIs. It is an improvement over previous methods in terms of convenience (a single extraction procedure for six major TKIs, reducing significantly the analytical time), sensitivity, selectivity and throughput. It may contribute to filling the current knowledge gaps in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationships of the latest TKIs developed after imatinib and better define their therapeutic ranges in different patient populations in order to evaluate whether a systematic TDM-guided dose adjustment of these anticancer drugs could contribute to minimize the risk of major adverse reactions and to increase the probability of efficient, long lasting, therapeutic response.", relevance: "0.79" },

TKIs have proven to be successful in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and other malignancies. Scattered reports have suggested that these agents appear to affect blood glucose (BG). We retrospectively studied the BG concentrations in diabetic (17) and nondiabetic (61) patients treated with dasatinib (8), imatinib (39), sorafenib (23), and sunitinib (30) in our clinical practice.

However, it is difficult to use in vitro dissolution results to predict in vivo dissolution, particularly the pH-dependent solubility of weak acid and base drugs, because the USP apparatus contains one vessel with a fixed pH for the test drug, limiting insight into in vivo drug dissolution of weak acid and weak base drugs. This discrepancy underscores the need to develop new in vitro dissolution methodology that better predicts in vivo response to assure the therapeutic efficacy and safety of oral drug products. Thus, the development of the in vivo predictive dissolution (IPD) methodology is necessitated. The major goals of in vitro dissolution are to ensure the performance of oral drug products and the support of drug formulation design, including bioequivalence (BE). Orally administered anticancer drugs, such as dasatinib and erlotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), are used to treat various types of cancer. These drugs are weak bases that exhibit pH-dependent and high solubility in the acidic stomach and low solubility in the small intestine (>pH 6.0). Therefore, these drugs supersaturate and/or precipitate when they move from the stomach to the small intestine. Also of importance, gastric acidity for cancer patients may be altered with aging (reduction of gastric fluid secretion) and/or co-administration of acid-reducing agents. These may result in changes to the dissolution profiles of weak base and the reduction of drug absorption and efficacy. In vitro dissolution methodologies that assess the impact of these physiological changes in the GI condition are expected to better predict in vivo dissolution of oral medications for patients and, hence, better assess efficacy, toxicity and safety concerns. The objective of this present study is to determine the initial conditions for a mini-Gastrointestinal Simulator (mGIS) to assess in vivo dissolution of BCS class IIb drugs, dasatinib as a model drug, including the different gastric condition. The maximum dissolution of dasatinib with USP dissolution apparatus II was less than 1% in pH 6.5 SIF, while the one with mGIS (pH 1.2 SGF/pH 6.5 SIF) reached almost 100%. The supersaturation and precipitation of dasatinib were observed in the in vitro dissolution studies with mGIS but not with USP apparatus II. Additionally, dasatinib dissolution with mGIS was reduced to less than 10% when the gastric pH was elevated, suggesting the co-administration of acid reducing agents will decrease the oral bioavailability of dasatinib. Accurate prediction of in vivo drug dissolution would be beneficial for assuring product safety and efficacy for patients. To this end, we have created a new in vitro dissolution system, mGIS, to predict the in vivo dissolution phenomena of a weak base drug, dasatinib. The experimental results when combined with in silico simulation suggest that the mGIS predicted the in vivo dissolution well due to the elevation of gastric pH. Thus, mGIS might be suitable to predict in vivo dissolution of weak basic drugs. This mGIS methodology is expected to significantly advance the prediction of in vivo drug dissolution. It is also expected to assist in optimizing product development and drug formulation design in support of Quality by Design (QbD) initiatives. ", relevance: "0.78" },

Each test compound was then topically applied on the ear. Ear swelling, epidermal thickness and levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured. The skin atrophy induced by the compounds was tested during prolonged application on the dorsal skin of hairless mice, followed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. Dasatinib and LCB 03-0110 suppressed the symptoms of ACD such as ear swelling, increase in epidermal thickness and synthesis of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor- and interferon-) in a dose-dependent manner. The two compounds showed near-equal potency to tacrolimus; however, their potency was lower than that of triamcinolone acetonide. Prolonged treatment with the two compounds did not induce any skin atrophy, whereas use of steroidal agents induced severe atrophy. Dasatinib and LCB 03-0110 could be used as effective agents for the treatment of ACD without the adverse side-effect of skin atrophy.", relevance: "0.78" },

The goal of this article is to review the experience to date of dasatinib and nilotinib in human pregnancy, specifically dasatinib and nilotinib dose, length of exposure, trimester of use, as well as patient and fetal outcomes. Based on the limited data, both dasatinib and nilotinib may cause fetal harm. Additionally, thorough analysis of the available literature indicates no correlation between dasatinib nor nilotinib dose, length of exposure, trimester of use, and deleterious patient or fetal outcomes can be concluded. Therefore, health care professionals need to regularly counsel women of child bearing potential with chronic myeloid leukemia regarding the risks of taking dasatinib or nilotinib during pregnancy.

In vitro, dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL. The efficacy and tolerability of oral dasatinib has been established in the START phase II trials in adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) who were intolerant or resistant to imatinib, and optimal dasatinib dosage regimens were identified in phase III randomized trials. In patients with chronic phase CML, the major cytogenetic response rate in the START-C trial (median follow-up 15.2 months) was 59% with dasatinib, and in the randomized START-R trial (median follow-up 15 months), was greater with dasatinib than with high-dose imatinib (52% vs 33%). Major hematologic response rates with dasatinib were 63% in patients with accelerated phase CML (follow-up > or =9 months; START-A trial), 34% in patients with myeloid blast phase CML and 35% in those with lymphoid blast phase CML (follow-up > or =12 months; START-B and START-L trials), and 41% in patients with Ph-positive ALL (follow-up > or =12 months; START-L trial). Based on phase III results, a once-daily dasatinib regimen is considered optimal in chronic phase CML (starting dosage 100 mg once daily), while a twice-daily regimen continues to be recommended in accelerated phase, myeloid blast phase or lymphoid blast phase CML and Ph-positive ALL (starting dosage 70 mg twice daily).

However, in some dasatinib-treated leukemia patients, clonal lymphocytosis with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology develops, and this is associated with enhanced therapeutic responses. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for this paradoxical observation, we conducted detailed phenotypic and functional analyses of T-cell and NK-cell populations from 25 dasatinib-treated leukemia patients. All tested patients with LGL expansions (15/16) were cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin (IgG) seropositive with high frequencies of CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cells; 5/16 LGL patients also experienced symptomatic CMV reactivation during dasatinib therapy. Expanded T-cell and NK-cell populations exhibited late differentiated (CD27(-)CD57(+)) phenotypes; this was associated with a predisposition to apoptosis within the T-cell compartment and impaired NK-cell cytotoxicity. Only 3/9 non-LGL patients were CMV IgG seropositive. Dasatinib inhibited in vitro lymphocyte functions, similarly in LGL patients and controls. Notably, distinct CD8(high) and CD8(low) T-cell subsets were observed in LGL patients; this phenotypic dichotomy was also apparent in CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, and exhibited features consistent with antigen-driven activation. In addition, plasma levels of IP-10, IL-6, monokine induced by interferon- and interleukin-2R were significantly increased in LGL patients.

A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature, a review of manufacturer submissions and a critique and exploration of manufacturer submissions for accelerated phase and blast crisis CML were carried out and a decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in chronic phase CML. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODS: Key databases were searched for relevant studies from their inception to June 2009 [MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), EMBASE, (ISI Web of Science) Conference Proceedings Citation Index and four others]. One reviewer assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, with a sample checked by a second reviewer. The full text of relevant papers was obtained and screened against the full inclusion criteria independently by two reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Clinical effectiveness studies were synthesised through narrative review. ECONOMIC EVALUATION METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses reported in manufacturer submissions to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence were critically appraised and summarised narratively. In addition, the models for accelerated phase and blast crisis underwent a more detailed critique and exploration. Two separate decision-analytic models were developed for chronic phase CML, one simulating a cohort of individuals who have shown or developed resistance to normal dose imatinib and one representing individuals who have been unable to continue imatinib treatment owing to adverse events. One-way, multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore structural and parameter uncertainty.Fifteen studies were included in the systematic review. Chronic phase: effectiveness data were limited but dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic response and haematological response in both ImR and ImI populations. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it was extremely difficult to reach any conclusions regarding either agent in the ImR population. All three models (Novartis, PenTAG and Bristol-Myers Squibb) were seriously flawed in one way or another, as a consequence of the paucity of data appropriate to construct robust decision-analytic models. Accelerated and blast crisis: all available data originated from observational single-arm studies and there were considerable and potentially important differences in baseline characteristics which seriously undermined any process for making meaningful comparisons between treatments. Owing to a lack of available clinical data, de novo models of accelerated phase and blast crisis have not been developed. The economic evaluations carried out by the manufacturers of nilotinib and dasatinib were seriously undermined by the absence of evidence on high-dose imatinib in these populations.The study has been necessarily constrained by the paucity of available clinical data, the differences in definitions used in the studies and the subsequent impossibility of undertaking a meaningful cost-effectiveness analyses to inform all policy questions.Dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic and haematological responses in both ImR and ImI populations.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated combination of MET and c-SRC inhibitors is effective in multiple cancer types. Methods We analyzed the safety and efficacy of administering a c-SRC inhibitor (dasatinib) in combination with a MET inhibitor (crizotinib) in a two-arm concurrent phase I study. Arm A consisted of crizotinib fixed at 250mg twice per day with escalation of dasatinib. Arm B consisted of dasatinib fixed at 140mg daily with escalation of crizotinib. Endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and response (RECIST 1.1). Results We enrolled 61 patients (arm A: 31, arm B: 30). The most common cancers were sarcoma (21%) and prostate cancer (16%). In Arm A, at dose level 2 (DL2), 40% (2/5) experienced DLTs. In the expanded DL1, 21% (4/19) experienced DLTs (all grade 3).

Real-time assessment of potential tissue biomarkers of Src inhibition was used to optimize dosing.Eligibility criteria required that patients have measurable MBC, biopsiable tumor, and unlimited prior therapies. For the analysis of change in protein biomarkers of Src inhibition, focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p-Src, patients underwent metastatic biopsies at baseline and 4 weeks. Patients who tolerated the starting dose of dasatinib (50 or 70 mg orally twice daily) for the first 28-day cycle, and displayed suboptimal Src inhibition, were escalated to a higher dose (70 or 100 mg).The trial was closed early with 31 patients because of a statistical boundary that required at least 4 (13%) patients without disease progression to continue accrual.

Dasatinib was found to have selective activity in several tumor models in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase I study of dasatinib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or imatinib-refractory, Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia was performed. Dose levels of 50, 65, 85, and 110 mg/m/dose, administered orally twice daily for 28 days, with courses repeated without interruption, were studied. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with the initial dose.A total of 39 patients (solid tumors, n = 28; chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], n = 9; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 2) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 50, 65, and 85 mg/m dose levels. At 110 mg/m, two of six patients experienced DLT including grade 2 diarrhea and headache. In children with leukemia, grade 4 hypokalemia (50 mg/m), grade 3 diarrhea (85 mg/m), and grade 2 creatinine elevation (50 mg/m) were observed. DLT in later courses included pleural effusions, hemangiomatosis, and GI hemorrhage. There were three complete cytogenetic responses, three partial cytogenetic responses, and two partial/minimal cytogenetic responses observed in evaluable patients with CML.

Dasatinib and nilotinib, two newer drugs with higher potency than imatinib against BCR-ABL and activity against most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, have each shown superior efficacy compared with imatinib for first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML in randomized phase 3 trials. With 14 months follow-up time, available data suggest no obvious differences in efficacy between dasatinib and nilotinib. Compared with imatinib, dasatinib is associated with higher rates of pleural effusion and thrombocytopenia, but lower rates of edema, gastrointestinal AEs, musculoskeletal AEs, and rash. Nilotinib is associated with higher rates of dermatologic toxicity, headache, and biochemical abnormalities associated with hepatic and pancreatic toxicity compared with imatinib, but lower rates of edema, gastrointestinal AEs, muscle spasm, and neutropenia. Several studies have shown that poor adherence to imatinib detrimentally affects responses and should be considered in patients with a suboptimal response.

We have recently shown that low concentrations of dasatinib (<0.1 M) promote IgE-dependent secretion of histamine in basophils, especially in allergic individuals. In the current study, we asked whether glucocorticosteroids inhibit dasatinib-induced activation of basophils.Basophils were preincubated with dexamethasone, prednisolone and hydrocortisone for 24 h, and were then exposed to an anti-IgE antibody (normal basophils) or the allergens Bet v 1 and Phl p 5 (allergic patients) with or without low concentrations of dasatinib (0.025 M).

However, some patients may experience resistance or intolerance to imatinib over time. For these patients, two excellent therapeutic options are available. Dasatinib, approved in 2006 for the treatment of patients with CML in all phases who experience imatinib resistance or intolerance, has displayed significant efficacy, with a 2-year follow-up showing durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses, as well as prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Nilotinib was approved in 2007 for the treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase or CML in accelerated phase, resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib, based on strong efficacy as well as a favorable safety profile. Several factors, including mutation status, patient history, and existing comorbidities can impact the decision to use dasatinib or nilotinib, or pursue other options such as allogeneic stem cell transplant. The purpose of this review article is to shed light on a further consideration when deciding which agent to use, based on the efficacy and safety of dasatinib and nilotinib. This consideration involves the differences in both the imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients enrolled in the pivotal studies for each agent, as well as other trial criteria.", relevance: "0.75" },

However, while the short-term response to imatinib is high, there are some concerns that the long-term response is substantially lower. Durable response with imatinib is difficult to achieve in patients with resistant disease. The use of higher doses has also been associated with increased toxicity and intolerance.

This article details the existing evidence on the clinical efficacy, safety and value for money of dasatinib in the treatment of imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Yet, hematologic toxicity and fluid retention demand a dose modification or treatment discontinuation in selected patients. Patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib were retrospectively evaluated based on the toxicity-guided administration of a dose-reduced dasatinib regimen. Patients were treated with an on/off regimen (3 to 5 days on, 2 to 4 days off) to allow regression of dasatinib-dependent off-target toxicity. Patients were followed up by routine hematologic and cytogenetic assessment and molecular monitoring to safeguard clinical response to the altered drug schedule. Thirty-three CML patients primarily in chronic phase with imatinib intolerance (n = 11) or resistance (n = 22) were investigated. Nonexclusive reasons for dose reduction were hematologic toxicity (17/33, 51%) and pleural effusions (18/33, 55%). On/off treatment with a weekend drug holiday significantly reduced pleural effusions and hematologic toxicity. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed effective disease control despite reduced total weekly dasatinib doses, either demonstrated by achieving an improved response level (12/31) or keeping the response level achieved by conventional continuous dosing (6/31). Of note, 10/12 patients with subsequently improved response have been treated for a minimum of 6 months with continuous dosing dasatinib regimens without having achieved the response level achieved after allowing drug holiday.

A 50-year-old male presented with pancytopenia, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lytic bone lesions in the pelvis. The patient was found to have systemic mastocytosis (SM) and acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML) positive for KIT(D816V) and therefore diagnosed with SM with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). Both primary CD34+ cells containing myeloblasts and CD34- cells containing mastocytes obtained from the diagnostic BM lost viability markedly by in vitro dasatinib treatment. In addition, dasatinib diminished activity of STAT5, STAT3, AKT and ERK and attenuated the levels of c-KIT. The patient achieved a hematologic complete remission (HCR) by two induction chemotherapies with residual mastocytes. Dasatinib (70mg PO bid, days 1-4) was added to consolidation treatments composed of four cycles of high dose cytarabine and was then continued as maintenance therapy (50mg PO bid). Periodic bone marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsies (eight over 18 months) were performed. The patient remained in HCR, and the mastocyte burden decreased by 50%. The bone lytic lesions improved. The KIT(D816V)mutation progressively decreased and became undetectable in the last three BM analyses. This result was confirmed by an independent laboratory showing a lack of c-KIT mutation in both CD34+ cells and CD34- cells in the last BM. No significant adverse effects of dasatinib occurred.

Studied patients had continuous enrollment  1 month prior to and after the index date, defined as the first prescription for dasatinib or nilotinib. Patients were followed for up to 6 months from the index date to the earliest of the termination of healthcare plan enrollment or end of data availability. Patients with bone marrow or stem cell transplant during the study period were excluded. Poisson regression models were used to compare healthcare resource utilization between the two groups. Results were reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR). Healthcare cost differences were estimated for each cost component using generalized linear models or two-part models. Treatment adherence was measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and compared using generalized linear models. Multivariate regressions were used to control for potential confounding factors.A total of 521 CML patients receiving second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (452 dasatinib and 69 nilotinib) were studied.

We have analyzed the kinases targeted by dasatinib by using an unbiased chemical proteomics approach to detect binding proteins directly from lysates of CML cells. Besides Abl and Src kinases, we have identified the Tec kinases Btk and Tec, but not Itk, as major binders of dasatinib. The kinase activity of Btk and Tec, but not of Itk, was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib in vitro and in cultured cells. We identified the gatekeeper residue as the critical determinant of dasatinib susceptibility. Mutation of Thr-474 in Btk to Ile and Thr-442 in Tec to Ile conferred resistance to dasatinib, whereas mutation of the corresponding residue in Itk (Phe-435) to Thr sensitized the otherwise insensitive Itk to dasatinib. The configuration of this residue may be a predictor for dasatinib sensitivity across the kinome. Analysis of mast cells derived from Btk-deficient mice suggested that inhibition of Btk by dasatinib may be responsible for the observed reduction in histamine release upon dasatinib treatment. Furthermore, dasatinib inhibited histamine release in primary human basophils and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in immune cells.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting up-regulated profibrotic pathways, such as imatinib mesylate, have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for patients with scGVHD. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. We present here the first direct clinical evidence, from 3 patients treated in a small single-center series, suggesting that dasatinib can be a therapeutic option for patients with severe scGVHD resistant or intolerant to imatinib. All patients achieved partial response, with improvement in scGHVD target organs severity, joint mobility, lung impairment, and deep fibrotic lesions.

To test this hypothesis, H9c2 cells were incubated with dasatinib at two concentrations (20 and 40M). Thereafter, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, BNP, and -MHC were determined at gene expression level. Our findings showed that dasatinib induces the CYP1A1, CYP1B1, BNP, and -MHC mRNA. The involvement of AhR/CYP1A1 pathway in dasatinib toxicity was tested by resveratrol (RES), an AhR antagonist. Interestingly, the increase in mRNA of different genes by dasatinib was not affected by RES, which confirms that these effects are not mediated through AhR.

Use of targeted therapy that inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity may lead to hematologic and cytogenetic responses in affected individuals. The oral TK inhibitor dasatinib was approved in 2006 for use in patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are unable to tolerate or have not responded to other treatments.This paper reviews the available data on dasatinib, including its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, findings of in vitro and in vivo studies, adverse effects, and potential place in therapy.Pertinent information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2007), EMBASE (1980-first quarter 2007), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2007) using the terms dasatinib, BMS-354825, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Sprycel, Philadelphia chromosome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All clinical studies and case reports published at the time of the search were included in this review.Observed mutations in the amino acid sequence of BCR-ABL cause the failure of treatment with existing TK inhibitors. Dasatinib has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against BCR-ABL, including mutations that are resistant to other available TK inhibitors. Preliminary results are available from several noncomparative studies of dasatinib in patients who were unable to tolerate or were resistant to previous therapies. The 5 phases of START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) represent the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of dasatinib in the treatment of patients in all stages of CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL who had undergone previous treatment for leukemia. Dasatanib had the greatest benefit in patients in the chronic phase of CML, with complete hematologic responses in 90% of patients, 52% of whom achieved a major hematologic response. Compared with those in the chronic phase, patients in the accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML, or with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had lower responses. In the START-R trial, which compared the response to dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (800 mg/d), both regimens had comparable ability to induce a complete hematologic response (95% and 93%, respectively), although more patients achieved a major cytogenetic response with dasatinib (32% vs 7%). Adverse effects include significant myelosuppression. Dasatinib may have the potential for use in the management of nonleukemic malignancies.Dasatinib has a wider spectrum of activity against a broader range of BCR-ABL forms than existing TK inhibitors.

To determine the utility of the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS) surveillance database for identifying AEs possibly associated with the BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in the postmarketing patient population, we conducted Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker disproportionality analyses of FAERS reports on AEs in relevant system organ classes. Signals consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents as well as signals for less well-described AEs were detected. Bone marrow necrosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, and peritoneal fluid retention events were uniquely associated with imatinib. AEs that most commonly reached the threshold for dasatinib consisted of terms relating to hemorrhage and fluid retention, including pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Most terms that reached the threshold solely with nilotinib were related to peripheral and cardiac vascular events. Although this type of analysis cannot determine AE incidence or establish causality, these findings elucidate the AEs reported in patients treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors across multiple clinical trials and in the community setting for all approved and nonapproved indications, suggesting drug-AE associations warrant further investigation.

Src kinase activation has been linked to Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis and CML progression. In addition to binding Abl kinase with less stringent conformational requirements than imatinib, dasatinib is a potent Src kinase inhibitor. In the current study, we report on 23 patients with CML (19 of them in accelerated or blastic phases) treated with dasatinib after treatment failure with both imatinib and nilotinib. More than half (13; 57%) of 23 patients responded to dasatinib: 10 (43%) had a complete hematologic response (CHR), including 7 (30%) who had a cytogenetic response (2 complete, 4 partial, and 1 minor).

In this line, imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI), has excellent efficacy in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. It has opened the way to the development of additional TKIs against chronic myeloid leukemia, including nilotinib and dasatinib. TKIs are prescribed for prolonged periods, often in patients with comorbidities. Therefore, they are regularly co-administered along with treatments at risk of drug-drug interactions. This aspect has been partially addressed so far, calling for a comprehensive review of the published data. We review here the available evidence and pharmacologic mechanisms of interactions between imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib and widely prescribed co-medications, including known inhibitors or inducers of cytochromes P450 or drug transporters. Information is mostly available for imatinib mesylate, well introduced in clinical practice. Several pharmacokinetic aspects yet remain insufficiently investigated for these drugs.

Minimal residual disease (mrd) is a useful tool for predicting leukemia relapse. However, there is no consensus on how to treat children with elevation of BCR-ABL transcripts but no evidence of hematologic relapse during chemotherapy combined with imatinib. Here, we report the case of a child with Ph+ all who had persistent elevation of mrd, but no evidence of hematologic relapse while receiving imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy. Dasatinib was substituted for imatinib because no suitable donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) was available. Less-intensive chemotherapy with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine was administered concomitantly. No serious adverse events were encountered. With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. This report is the first about the long-term use of dasatinib in patients with Ph+ all and mrd elevation but hematologic remission during imatinib chemotherapy. In a similar situation, chemotherapy combined with dasatinib instead of allogeneic hsct could be considered to avoid hsct-related mortality and morbidity. Clinical trials are needed.

Although each TKI binds to a unique profile of molecular targets in leukemic cells and vascular cells, the exact etiology of drug-induced vasculopathies remains uncertain. Recent data suggest that predisposing molecular factors, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors as well as certain comorbidities contribute to the etiology of VAE in these patients. In addition, direct effects of these TKI on vascular endothelial cells have been demonstrated and are considered to contribute essentially to VAE evolution.

It has been approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor and has been found efficacious in other neoplastic diseases. Nilotinib and dasatinib, a second-generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), were developed in response to findings of emerging imatinib resistance or intolerance to the drug. Cutaneous reactions are the most common nonhematologic side effect of these drugs, and their management is challenging especially in the absence of alternative anticancer agents.

Methods Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) who were being treated with low-dose imatinib (200 mg/day), but were resistant to this agent were enrolled in the current study (referred to as the LD-CML study). Results There subjects included 9 patients (4 men and 5 women); all were treated with dasatinib at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Among 8 patients who had not experienced major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1 transcript 0.1% according to International Scale [IS]) at study enrollment, 5 attained MMR by 12 months. In particular, 3 of 9 patients demonstrated a deep molecular response (DMR; IS 0.0069%) by 18 months. Five patients developed lymphocytosis accompanied by cytotoxic lymphocyte predominance. There was no mortality or disease progression, and all continue to receive dasatinib therapy at 18 months with only 2 patients requiring dose reduction. Toxicities were mild-to-moderate, and pleural effusion was observed in 1 patient (grade 1). Conclusion Low-dose dasatinib can attain MMR and DMR without severe toxicity in patients with CML-CP who are unable to achieve MMR with low-dose imatinib. Switching to low-dose dasatinib should therefore be considered for patients in this setting, especially if they are otherwise considering a cessation of treatment.", relevance: "0.71" },

Non-adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with disease progression.To evaluate the need for adherence-enhancing interventions, this study was designed to determine the proportion of chronic myeloid leukemia patients non-adherent to their tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen. The secondary objective was to identify the influence of patient characteristics on tyrosine kinase inhibitor adherence.Cross-sectional retrospective chart and dispensing record reviews were performed to identify patients receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor from 1 June 2010 to 31 January 2012. Adherence was evaluated using the medication possession ratio.A total of 124 patients were included. Thirty-eight (31%) patients were non-adherent to their tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen. Patients not receiving concurrent medications were more likely to be non-adherent (odds ratio (OR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-5.13, p=0.04).

Efficacy was assessed in Segment 2 using both positron emission tomography and computed tomography.Hematologic toxicities were markedly less than those observed in patients with leukemia, whereas nonhematologic toxicities were similar. The authors determined that the maximum recommended dose was 180 mg once daily based on the incidence of pleural effusion. Coadministration of ketoconazole led to a marked increase in dasatinib exposure, which was correlated with an increase in corrected QT (QTc) values of approximately 6 msec. No adverse cardiac events were observed.The dose-limiting toxic effect for dasatinib was pleural effusion.

Moreover, long-term survival rates are markedly decreased when transplanted patients are not in complete remission. Incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors into transplantation strategy in patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia may improve prognosis of the disease. Imatinib combined with conventional chemotherapy and used in conjunction with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has improved long-term survival rates.

In TKI therapy for CML patients, therapeutic drug monitoring is a new strategy for dosage optimization to obtain a faster and more effective clinical response. The imatinib plasma trough concentration (C) should be set above 1000ng/mL to obtain a response and below 3000ng/mL to avoid serious adverse events such as neutropenia. For patients with a UGT1A1*6/*6, *6/*28, or *28/*28 genotype initially administered 300-400mg/d, a target nilotinib C of 500ng/mL is recommended to prevent elevation of bilirubin levels, whereas for patients with the UGT1A1*1 allele initially administered 600mg/d, a target nilotinib C of 800ng/mL is recommended.

The pathways and the molecular mechanisms to improve lifespan and healthspan are controlled by behavioral, pharmacologic and dietary factors, which remain largely unknown. Among them, naturally occurring compounds, such as polyphenols, are considered potential antiaging agents, because of their ability to modulate some of the evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of aging, including oxidative damage, inflammation, cell senescence, and autophagy. Initially, these compounds gained researchers attention due to their ability to extend the lifespan of simple model organisms. More recently, some of them have been proposed as senolytic agents to protect against age-related disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.

As Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, has been implicated as one of the major signaling molecules in VEGF-mediated neovascularization, the present study aimed to investigate whether dasatinib, a potent Src kinase inhibitor, could suppress pathological ocular neovascularization in murine models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV).Tube formation, scratch wounding migration, and cell proliferation assays were performed to measure the inhibitory effect of dasatinib on VEGF-induced angiogenesis in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. Murine models of OIR and laser-induced CNV were used to assess the preventive effect of an intravitreal injection of dasatinib on pathological neovascularization in the retina and choroid. Neovascularization and Src phosphorylation were evaluated with immunofluorescence staining.Dasatinib efficiently inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial proliferation, wounding migration, and tube formation. In mice with OIR and laser injury-induced CNV, eyes treated with a single intravitreal injection of dasatinib exhibited significant decreases in pathological neovascularization compared with that of controls injected with vehicle. The dasatinib-treated OIR mice also showed a decrease in Src phosphorylation in the periretinal tufts. The intravitreal injection of dasatinib did not cause ocular toxicity at the treatment dose administered.These results demonstrated that dasatinib suppressed pathological neovascularization in the mouse retina and choroid.

Caveolin-1 is the principal structural component of caveolae in vivo. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that caveolin-1 functions as a transformation suppressor protein. In fact, caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are lost or reduced during cell transformation by activated oncogenes. Interestingly, the human caveolin-1 gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus (7q31.1). We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of caveolin-1 arrests mouse embryonic fibroblasts in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle through activation of a p53/p21-dependent pathway, indicating a role of caveolin-1 in mediating growth arrest. However, it remains unknown whether overexpression of caveolin-1 promotes cellular senescence in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts transgenically overexpressing caveolin-1 show: 1) a reduced proliferative lifespan; 2) senescence-like cell morphology; and 3) a senescence-associated increase in beta-galactosidase activity. These results indicate for the first time that the expression of caveolin-1 in vivo is sufficient to promote and maintain the senescent phenotype. Subcytotoxic oxidative stress is known to induce premature senescence in diploid fibroblasts. Interestingly, we show that subcytotoxic level of hydrogen peroxide induces premature senescence in NIH 3T3 cells and increases endogenous caveolin-1 expression. Importantly, quercetin and vitamin E, two antioxidant agents, successfully prevent the premature senescent phenotype and the up-regulation of caveolin-1 induced by hydrogen peroxide. Also, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide alone, but not in combination with quercetin, stimulates the caveolin-1 promoter activity. Interestingly, premature senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide is greatly reduced in NIH 3T3 cells harboring antisense caveolin-1. Importantly, induction of premature senescence is recovered when caveolin-1 levels are restored. Taken together, these results clearly indicate a central role for caveolin-1 in promoting cellular senescence and they suggest the hypothesis that premature senescence may represent a tumor suppressor function mediated by caveolin-1 in vivo.", relevance: "0.69" },

Few studies have addressed the impact of dasatinib on normal blood cells, especially in vivo. Here we show that dasatinib leads to a reduced number of human CD19+ peripheral B cells owing to a strong induction of apoptosis. In contrast, no similar effect on T-cell viability was observed. However, dasatinib induced a comparable broad inhibition of the early events of B- and T-cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, dasatinib was shown to be a more pronounced inhibitor of both basal and B-cell receptor-induced activity of Brutons tyrosine kinase and PLC2 compared with the more specific Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Human progenitor B cells from the pre-B stage were sensitive to dasatinib. In an in vivo murine model, dasatinib reduced B-lineage cells in the bone marrow with a marked effect on the pre-B subpopulation. Dasatinib led to a reduced spleen size, with a loss of large immature transitional immunoglobulin M(+)/immunoglobulin D(-) B cells and a reduction in germinal center B cells.

Imatinib mesylate, a BCR-ABL TK inhibitor, is the frontline therapy for CML. Despite the stunning efficacy of this agent, a small number of patients develop a suboptimal response or resistance to imatinib. In newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML, the rate of resistance to imatinib at 4 years was up to 20%, increasing to 70% to 90% for patients in the accelerated/blastic phase. Resistance to imatinib led to the development of novel TK inhibitors such as dasatinib. Several clinical trials have reported more durable complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses with this agent in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib is well tolerated and has broad efficacy, resulting in durable responses in patients with any BCR-ABL mutation except for T3151 and mutations in codon 317 - most commonly F317L - including mutations that were highly resistant to imatinib, such as L248, Y253, E255, F359, and H396. Dasatinib is recommended for CML in chronic, blastic or accelerated phase that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib was approved by the FDA at 100 mg once daily as the starting dose in patients with chronic phase CML and at 70 mg twice daily in patients with accelerated or blastic phase CML. Various clinical trial results provided evidence that resistance to one TK inhibitor can be reversed with the use of a different TK inhibitor (TKI). Other second-generation TKIs with activity in CML include nilotinib, bosutinib and INNO 406.

While imatinib remains a frontline therapy for CML, patients with advanced disease frequently develop resistance to imatinib therapy through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include insufficient potency at therapeutic doses, activation of alternate oncogenic pathways, and overexpression of the multidrug-resistant gene. One of the possible causes of imatinib-acquired resistance is associated with increased expression of the SRC-related kinase Lyn and loss of BCR-ABL dependence arising from sequence mutations.

Choosing the most appropriate TKI requires clinicians to consider a host of patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors, not the least of which include the safety profiles of the agents. This review discusses the potential impact of treatment-, patient-, and disease-related characteristics on the emergence of adverse events during TKI therapy, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms believed to be responsible for a number of important adverse events associated with these agents and what implications they may have for treatment choice, particularly in the setting of first-line treatment. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles that described the molecular mechanisms of BCR-ABL1-mediated leukemic transformation, the efficacy and safety of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib in patients with CML, the kinase-binding spectrum of each TKI, and evidence suggesting a link between the TKI-binding profile and adverse events. The pattern of adverse events associated with each agent is important when selecting treatment with a TKI. Clinical studies suggest that imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib have differing safety profiles, which are in part attributable to the specificity and selectivity of each agent. Although much basic research must be conducted to further illuminate the mechanisms responsible for TKI-related adverse events, on- and off-target effects are believed to be at least partly responsible for cardiovascular toxicity, myelosuppression, fluid retention, gastrointestinal toxicity, and dermatologic toxicity.

COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts.

We previously showed that the sensors AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), involved in survival pathways and neuroprotection, were affected during the course of HSV-1 infection. To evaluate if natural activators of the AMPK/Sirt1 axis, such as Resveratrol and Quercetin could reduce viral propagation and/or counteract the effects of neuronal infection, we analyzed progeny virion production, neuronal viability and neurodegenerative events during HSV-1 infection. We found that the activators of AMPK/Sirt1 axis, increased the viability of infected neurons, significantly reduced the viral titer in the supernatant and the expression of viral genes. More importantly, pretreatment of neurons with Resveratrol or Quercetin significantly reduced the levels of caspase-3 cleaved- and hyperphosphorylated tau associated with HSV-1 infection.

Among four small molecules with anti-aging and stem cell-protection properties (rapamycin, resveratrol, quercetin and melatonin), colony forming, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation assay showed that melatonin was the most efficient to preserve self-renewal and differentiation properties of rat bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) after long-term passaging.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of a SRC inhibitor, dasatinib, on the ability of human prostate cancer cell to complete key steps in the metastatic process, including invasion and angiogenesis. Dasatinib treatment impaired the metastatic phenotypes of the human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP, by significantly reducing migration and invasion in modified Boyden chambers. Inhibition of phosphorylation, and therefore enhanced activation, of SRC and key downstream signaling pathway elements, including FAK, STAT3, Paxillin, and Akt, as determined by Western blotting, also was observed. This suggests that dasatinib interferes with critical cell functions associated with the metastatic cascade. Dasatinib also had direct effects on the ability of microvascular endothelial cells to form tubes in vitro and impaired the ability of PC-3 cells to induce angiogenesis in vivo. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that SRC inhibition by dasatinib may have utility in reducing the metastatic spread of prostate cancer cells.", relevance: "0.65" },

We have previously shown that up-regulation of caveolin-1 was required for oxidative stress-induced premature senescence in fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying caveolin-1 up-regulation in senescent cells remain unknown. Here, we show that subcytotoxic oxidative stress generated by hydrogen peroxide application promotes premature senescence and stimulates the activity of a (-1,296) caveolin-1 promoter reporter gene construct in fibroblasts. Functional deletion analysis mapped the oxidative stress response elements of the mouse caveolin-1 promoter to the sequences -244/-222 and -124/-101. The hydrogen peroxide-mediated activation of both Cav-1 (-244/-222) and Cav-1 (-124/-101) was prevented by the antioxidant quercetin. Combination of electrophoretic mobility shift studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Sp1 overexpression experiments, as well as promoter mutagenesis identifies enhanced Sp1 binding to two GC-boxes at -238/-231 and -118/-106 as the core mechanism of oxidative stress-triggered caveolin-1 transactivation. In addition, signaling studies show p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as the upstream regulator of Sp1-mediated activation of the caveolin-1 promoter following oxidative stress. Inhibition of p38 MAPK prevents the oxidant-induced Sp1-mediated up-regulation of caveolin-1 protein expression and development of premature senescence. Finally, we show that oxidative stress induces p38-mediated up-regulation of caveolin-1 and premature senescence in normal human mammary epithelial cells but not in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which do not express caveolin-1 and undergo apoptosis. This study delineates for the first time the molecular mechanisms that modulate caveolin-1 gene transcription upon oxidative stress and brings new insights into the redox control of cellular senescence in both normal and cancer cells.", relevance: "0.64" },

The cell viability was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8.Astragaloside increases the expression of collagen-I (Col1) downregulated by UVB. UVB-induced oxidative stress and photoaging could be inhibited by astragaloside. The degradation of Col1 caused by UVB irradiation through activated ERK and p38 signals could be suppressed by astragaloside. Importantly, autophagy was induced by astragaloside. Col1 could be further accumulated by chloroquine but decreased by 3-methyladenine in photoaged cell after treatment of astragaloside.Autophagy play essential roles, at least partially, in modulating the formation and degradation of Col1 in photoaging cell model.

These polyphenols modulate the activity of several proteins involved in cell growth and death in cancer cells, including histone deacetylases (HDAC), but the role of HDAC in senescence induced by Rsv and Quer is unclear. The HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) potentiated the pro-senescent effect of Rsv and Quer in human and rat glioma cell lines but not in normal rat astrocytes. Furthermore, the increment of Quer-induced senescence by NaB was accompanied by an increase of reactive oxygen species levels and an increment of the number of cells with nuclear abnormalities.

Using a hypothesis-driven bioinformatics-based approach, we recently identified pro-survival pathways in human senescent cells that contribute to their resistance to apoptosis.

Among other pro-survival regulators identified was Bcl-xl. Here, we tested whether the Bcl-2 family inhibitors, navitoclax (N) and TW-37 (T), are senolytic. Like D and Q, N is senolytic in some, but not all types of senescent cells: N reduced viability of senescent human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVECs), IMR90 human lung fibroblasts, and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but not human primary preadipocytes, consistent with our previous finding that Bcl-xl siRNA is senolytic in HUVECs, but not preadipocytes. In contrast, T had little senolytic activity. N targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w, while T targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1.

Sixteen AEs were shared by all five TKIs/mAbs, and each of 17 cardiotoxicity AEs was associated with at least one TKI/mAb. As an example, we analyzed cardiac failure using the relations established in OAE with other ontologies and demonstrated that one of the biological processes associated with cardiac failure maps to the genes associated with heart contraction.By expanding the existing OAE ontological design, our TKI use case demonstrated that the combination of OAE and MedDRA() provides a semantic framework to link clinical phenotypes of adverse drug events to biological mechanisms.", relevance: "0.58" },

The present study was carried out to compare the effect of a novel agent glucosamine alendronate (GA) alone and is combination with dihydroquercetin (DHQ) against the effect of a known drug alendronate (ALN) in the senescence-accelerated OXYS rats as model of osteoporosis.Male OXYS and Wistar (control) rats were randomized across four experimental groups (n=15), which received 1.26 mg GA, 0.84 mg ALN, or 1.26 mg GA + 5.06 mg DHQ per kg of body weight. Untreated rats were used as control groups. At the end of treatment, the bone mineral density (BMD), bone biomechanical properties, and the levels of serum osteocalcin, C-terminal crosslinked telopeptides of type I collagen (-CTx) and calcium were measured.All treatments increased BMD in rats of both strains, but the improvement was more pronounced in OXYS rats: GA+DHQ increased both the strength of the femur by 20 per cent (P<0.01) and BMD by 7.6 per cent (P<0.023). GA+DHQ and ALN reduced serum -CTx in OXYS rats. Only GA increased the level of osteocalcin in OXYS rats (P<0.05). ALN increased the cross-sectional area of the femur by 9 per cent (P<0.04) in OXYS and by 12 per cent (P<0.05) in Wistar rats.The combined treatment with GA+DHQ appears to be more effective at maintaining strength of the femur and BMD in OXYS rats, when compared to the individual drugs GA and ALN.", relevance: "0.57" },

Sunrouge is a green tea cultivar that contains EGCG and several other bioactive components such as quercetin, myricetin, cyanidin and delphinidin. We compared the effects of Sunrouge and Yabukita, the most popular Japanese green tea cultivar, on cognitive function in the senescence-accelerated mouse Prone8. These mice were fed an experimental diet containing Sunrouge extract (SRE) or Yabukita extract (YBE). SRE feeding significantly prevented cognitive decline, whereas YBE feeding had little effect. Moreover, SRE feeding prevented elevation of the amyloid-42 level while improving the gene expression of neprilysin and decreasing beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 in the brain. These preventive effects of SRE against cognitive decline were attributed to the characteristic composition of Sunrouge and strongly suggest that consumption of this cultivar could protect against age-related cognitive decline.", relevance: "0.57" },

Imatinib and dasatinib are currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and nilotinib is expected to gain FDA approval soon. In addition, several other Abl TKIs are being evaluated in various clinical trials. Imatinib has also shown efficacy in the therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Because of their efficacy, more patients will receive Abl TKIs for a longer period of time. Imatinib was FDA approved after a short follow-up because of its exceptional efficacy and safety profile. The most common adverse events reported included fluid retention, fatigue, diarrhea, and muscle cramps. With longer follow-up, issues related to the long-term use of imatinib have been discussed. Our aim is to review the emerging safety issues of Abl TKIs after a longer follow-up.", relevance: "0.57" },

The analysis included 369 CML patients in the chronic or accelerated phases, selected from the CML Cooperative Study Group database; 25 events in 23 (6.2%) of these patients were VAEs. At the time of VAE incidence, nine patients were on treatment with imatinib, 12 with nilotinib, three with dasatinib, and one with bosutinib. VAE incidence comprised 13 cases of ischemic heart disease (IHD), eight of cerebral infarction (CI), and four of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). IHD incidence rate in the study population was higher than that in the age-matched general population, particularly in nilotinib-treated patients, while CI incidence rate was almost equivalent. Compared with the Suita score, the SCORE chart and the Framingham score risk assessment tools detected more patients with high or very high risk of VAEs. In conclusion, incidence of IHD requires closer monitoring in nilotinib-treated patients. More detailed investigations for determining the most useful tool to predict VAE incidence and long-term analysis of therapy-related VAE cases are needed for improving safety during TKI therapy.", relevance: "0.54" },

In this study, we examined the changes in the metabolome of specialized products in the bracts of Tilia platyphyllos from the appearance of the organ till the onset of senescence by LC-ESI-MS and data mining. A set of 504 natural products were detected, 241 of which showed significant seasonal variation (p<9.92E-5). Seven compounds were quantified and an additional 45 were putatively identified. These included flavonoid glycosides, catechins, procyanidins, quinic acid derivatives (including chlorogenic acid) and coumarins. Compared to bracts during flowering, young tissues were characterized by a relatively high diversity of polyphenolic substances. Higher amounts of flavonol glycosides (quercetin, kaempferol), catechins and derivatives have been observed. Deoxyhexosides were almost exclusive to this phenological stage. Changes of about one order of magnitude were not uncommon. For some substances, 5-fold differences were observed (calibration with authentic standards). Some compounds (e.g. the coumarin fraxin) were more prominent at the late fruit growth stage. It was shown that bracts gathered before or after flowering could potentially be therapeutically useful. Changes are rapid during the early phase of bract development: three different groups of compounds presented their maxima during the first 32 days. Considering seasonal variation is of extreme importance during bioactivity tests and screening candidate sources for bioactive natural products. In the case of T. platyphyllos, young and old bracts can be of interest because of their high diversity of distinct specialized metabolites.", relevance: "0.53" },
  { pmid: "29783751", date: "23 Mai, 2018", title: "Targeting Protein Quality Control Mechanisms by Natural Products to Promote Healthy Ageing", abstract: "Organismal ageing is associated with increased chance of morbidity or mortality and it is driven by diverse molecular pathways that are affected by both environmental and genetic factors. The progression of ageing correlates with the gradual accumulation of stressors and damaged biomolecules due to the time-dependent decline of stress resistance and functional capacity, which eventually compromise cellular homeodynamics. As protein machines carry out the majority of cellular functions, proteome quality control is critical for cellular functionality and is carried out through the curating activity of the proteostasis network (PN). Key components of the PN are the two main degradation machineries, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways along with several stress-responsive pathways, such as that of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which mobilises cytoprotective genomic responses against oxidative and/or xenobiotic damage. Reportedly, genetic or dietary interventions that activate components of the PN delay ageing in evolutionarily diverse organisms. Natural products (extracts or pure compounds) represent an extraordinary inventory of highly diverse structural scaffolds that offer promising activities towards meeting the challenge of increasing healthspan and/or delaying ageing (e.g., spermidine, quercetin or sulforaphane). Herein, we review those natural compounds that have been found to activate proteostatic and/or anti-stress cellular responses and hence have the potential to delay cellular senescence and/or in vivo ageing.", relevance: "0.52" },

Although this dasatinib-induced side effect is well known, this case clearly illustrates the importance of an accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment of complications of new agents which are easy to use since most of them are orally taken, and the difficulty to clearly separate drug origin and cancer morbidities. The patient recovered completely one month after discontinuation of dasatinib.
